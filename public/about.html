<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Tanvi — someone who loves turning curious “what ifs” into working circuits, codes, and ideas. 
   Whether it’s debugging stubborn lines of code, designing electronics that actually do something cool, or simply learning how tech shapes our everyday lives, I’m always exploring and building.

I blend creativity with technology — from tiny hardware hacks to larger projects that connect people and ideas. My portfolio is a mix of experiments, learnings, and little wins along the way. Think of it as my digital lab notebook, sprinkled with curiosity, a dash of persistence, and plenty of late-night brainstorming sessions.

When I’m not knee-deep in schematics or code, you’ll probably find me sketching out new ideas, geeking over futuristic tech, or learning something completely new (because why not?).

Let’s create, break, fix, and build that’s how innovation happens. .</p>
